  /* IDEAL LINE LENGTH (66ch)

  Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory line 
  length for a single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size. 
  The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded 
  as ideal. For multiple column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters. */
